            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <p>During my time at university and in my spare time I have learned programming skills such as C/C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Here are some projects I made over the last few years at university as well as some of my own personal work. To view gameplay or a finished product, click on the respective image.</p>

                    <h2>Bork Invaders - A Space Invaders Remake</h2>
                    <p>Here is a project I created in my first year of university, to the right is a screenshot of the game. It is a modern twist on a classic game with the defender as Gabe The Dog, the invaders as Pepe The Frog and other custom sounds and images to make it more
                        appealing. The game is programmed in Java using Processing, an open source computer programming language and integrated development environment (IDE). After completing the project for university I vastly improved the game in my spare time, updating all textures so they are in high definition. I also plan to add extras such as a full HUD and adding a leaderboard to the game.</p>

                    <p>In second year, I was part of a group to help create a web page for a university project. The project was to create a sliding tile game with features requested by a particular client. These include things such as categories of pictures that can be selected as well as a custom upload which the user can choose for themselves, a timer, scores and much more. The game is programmed in JavaScript. I worked on features such as being able to select the correct images, allowing custom uploads as well as the HTML structure and CSS.</p>

                    <h2>Phaser Code Camp</h2>
                    <p>In my 3rd year I was in a group, tasked with making an interactive web game that helps teach children, ages 7-12, the basics of coding. The first level teaches about variables, in particular integers, as well as game mechanics. From there it goes on teach about other variables such as booleans and strings. The game is made using a JavaScript library called Phaser.</p>

                    <h2>Jungle Run</h2>
                    <p>Another project in my 3rd year of university was to create a game in Unreal Engine with multiple game mechanics. I came up with the idea of Jungle Run. The aim of the game is to collect a crystal guarded by secret traps on a remote island in the middle of the ocean. The game is very detailed as uses many features within Unreal such as a level sequencer, particle systems, ambient sounds and a vast amount of blueprint scripts.</p>

                    <h2>Online Forum</h2>
                    <p>This is a project that I have been working on in my spare time. I started off with very little knowledge of back-end development from my time at university. However, throughout this project I was able to learn lots of techniques in SQL and vastly improve my knowledge of PHP. The forum has a vast variety of features such as a login system with customisable profiles and rich text editors for posting threads and replying to others. The current layout is designed for users of a Minecraft server.</p>

                    <h2>Custom Call of Duty</h2>
                    <p>When I was only around 13 years old I discovered you could make custom maps for both multiplayer and the game mode, Nazi Zombies, on Call of Duty: World at War. This was only available on the PC. I bought a copy and installed the official tools that Treyarch and Activision use themselves. This was the first time I had ever done any programming or designing for a video game. I made multiple custom maps for people to play and started to program in C++. To the left is an example of one of my maps, which is also my most popular.</p>

                    <h2>Booking System</h2>
                    <p>A few years ago I created a booking system for one of my relatives who was having problems with their current system. I successfully created a calendar showing all current bookings, both confirmed and unconfirmed with an option to book a date. The system has conditional checks such as overlapping dates. Once a booking is submitted an email is sent to the admin which can be confirmed through a unique URL and updates the calendar accordingly. There is also an admin interface that allows bookings to be deleted or updated.</p>
