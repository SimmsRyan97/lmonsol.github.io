            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.mmu.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU)</a> in 2019 with a BSc.</p>
            <p>For several years I wanted to work in the IT sector, particularly programming. I studied ICT after finishing school and then went on to study Computer Games Technology while at university. The course involved designing video games using well-known engines such as Unity and Unreal as well as learning C++ and website design.</p>

            <h2>Camp America</h2>
            <p>During my time at university I took part in <a href="https://www.campamerica.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Camp America</a>. I enjoyed being a camp counsellor, teaching programming to children and taking part in other fun activities. I lived with a host family just outside of Washington D.C. I worked at the same camp for two summers in 2017 and 2018. I received excellent feedback from parents and staff in both my summers there.</p>

            <h2>Teaching & Childcare</h2>
            <p>After enjoying this, I decided to pursue a career in teaching and got my first job as a supply practitioner within an early years setting. I have worked hard to acheive numerous qualifications including a Level 6 Early Years Teacher qualification.</p>
            <p>For a short period I had my own childcare business working from home, delivering high quality teaching, liaising with external agencies, social media promotion and talking to new parents as well as existing ones.</p>

            <h2>More Info</h2>
            <p>Over the last few years, I've spent many hours of my personal time in the evenings and/or weekends working on projects. These projects have been tested and used by more than 100 individual users. You can find these projects, and more information, by clicking the 'My Projects' link at the top of this page.</p>
